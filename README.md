## My process
### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- I built this project using Sass. It's my first doing something this big with Sass, so I had  a lot to learn. Prior to this, I had a good understanding of CSS Specificity but this helped me gain more insight into it


### Continued development

- I would need to work on the filter-blur prperty as it is currently not supported by Firefox but works well in chrome. 
- Also on the last page (technology), I need to learn how to change the images displayed based on the active viewport. 

### Useful resources

- I happened to stumble on Kevin Powell's video about typography just before I started working on this project. I used the clamp property for my fonts which he talks about here [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wARbgs5Fmuw)
